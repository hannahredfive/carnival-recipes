Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------

Servings: 24
Time: 4 hours

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

1. Mix together yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and 1/4 cup warm water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes.
3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
11. Cover wok with lid and steam buns over boiling water for 15 minutes.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
